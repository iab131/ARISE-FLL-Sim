<h2>💡 Why FLL Simulator?</h2>
<p>
We built this simulator as a team of two students to make robotics more <strong>accessible</strong>, <strong>engaging</strong>, and <strong>fun</strong> — especially for younger students who don’t have access to physical kits. Inspired by our experience in <strong>FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)</strong>, we wanted to give back to the community and help spark curiosity in STEM through a hands-on, interactive learning platform.
