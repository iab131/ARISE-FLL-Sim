<h2>💡 Why FLL Simulator?</h2>
<p>
I built this simulator to make robotics more <strong>accessible</strong>, <strong>engaging</strong>, and <strong>fun</strong>, especially for students who don’t have access to real-world kits. Inspired by my experience in <strong>FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)</strong>, I wanted to give back and create a tool that helps younger students explore robotics in a meaningful way.
